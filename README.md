<h2>Dark Tower HP loss calculation tool</h2>

This is my small documentation project on an old game called Dark Tower for the Pocket Dream Cast 100. This is a webtool to calculate the HP loss for all enemies
based on your player stats, in order to make smarter decisions about stat upgrades in the game.

The webtool can be found at: https://idrismania.github.io/
